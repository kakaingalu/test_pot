# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
## About
An introductory project on:
- nested loops and how to use them
- functions and how to you use them
- What the is difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
- What a prototype is
- Scope of variables
- header files and how to to use them with `#include`
## Requirements
- Ubuntu 14.04
- gcc 4.8.4
- no standard library functions
- allowed to use [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
## File Descriptions
### Mandatory
**[0-holberton.c](0-holberton.c)** - prints Holberton, followed by a new line.

**[1-alphabet.c](1-alphabet.c)** - function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

**[2-print_alphabet_x10.c](2-print_alphabet_x10.c)** - function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

**[3-islower.c](3-islower.c)** - function that checks for lowercase character.

**[4-isalpha.c](4-isalpha.c)** - function that checks for alphabetic character.

**[5-sign.c](5-sign.c)** - function that prints the sign of a number.

**[6-abs.c](6-abs.c)** - function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

**[7-print_last_digit.c](7-print_last_digit.c)** - function that prints the last digit of a number.

**[8-24_hours.c](8-24_hours.c)** - function that prints every minute of the day, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

**[9-times_table.c](9-times_table.c)** - function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

**[10-add.c](10-add.c)** - function that adds two integers and returns the result.

**[11-print_to_98.c](11-print_to_98.c)** - function that prints all natural numbers from `n` to 98, separated by a comma, followed by a new line.

### Advanced
**[100-times_table.c](100-times_table.c)** - function that prints the `n` times table, starting with 0, if 0 <= `n` <= 15.

**[101-natural.c](101-natural.c)** - computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line. Allowed to use the standard library.

**[102-fibonacci.c](102-fibonacci.c)** - prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, separated by comma, followed by a new line. Allowed to use the standard library.

**[103-fibonacci.c](103-fibonacci.c)** - finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, followed by a new line. Allowed to use the standard library.

**[104-fibonacci.c](104-fibonacci.c)** - finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line. Allowed to use the standard library.
